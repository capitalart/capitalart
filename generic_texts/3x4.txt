About the Artist – Robin Custance
G’day, I’m Robin Custance—Aboriginal Aussie artist, part-time Kangaroo whisperer, and lifelong storyteller through colour, line, and imagination. My journey began on Kaurna Country here in Adelaide, and my roots reach back to the Naracoorte region (Boandik Country). 

Every artwork I create—whether it’s dot painting, digital design, or contemporary Aussie landscape—carries a deep respect for Country, community, and the vibrant stories handed down through generations.

No matter the style or subject, my intention as an artist is always to tell stories and share genuine emotion. Whether I’m working with ancient dot techniques, digital brushes, or bold, modern colours, I pour heart and meaning into every piece.

My art is a way to give back and keep culture strong—blending the timeless with the modern, and weaving together my heritage with today’s creative spirit. When you bring my art into your home, you’re welcoming a piece of Australian story and soul, crafted with passion and a fair bit of character.

Did You Know? Aboriginal Art & the Spirit of Dot Painting
Aboriginal art is one of the world’s oldest creative traditions, with roots stretching back tens of thousands of years. From ancient rock art to vibrant canvases, each style and technique tells a story about connection to land, people, and spirit.

Did you know that the famous “dot painting” style only became widely known in the early 1970s, through the ground-breaking Papunya Tula movement in Central Australia? Visionary artists like Kaapa Tjampitjinpa, Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri, and Emily Kame Kngwarreye developed a new visual language using dots—not just for beauty, but to share and protect sacred Dreamtime stories and songlines.

In these works, each dot might represent a footprint, a star, or a ripple in the sand—a powerful link between artist, Country, and viewer.

Today, Aboriginal artists across Australia continue to adapt, innovate, and honour tradition in every medium—from dot paintings and digital art to sculpture and contemporary works. Every piece is part of a living story: a testament to resilience, creativity, and the unbreakable bond between people and place.

Thank you for supporting authentic Aboriginal and Australian art. Every purchase helps keep these stories and traditions alive!

Printing Tips:
For the best result, I always recommend using a quality professional print lab or one of the print-on-demand services listed below. This ensures vibrant colours and crisp detail—true to the spirit of the original artwork.
Avoid department store kiosks (like Big W or Harvey Norman), as they often can’t handle high-res art files and might leave you with a disappointing print.
