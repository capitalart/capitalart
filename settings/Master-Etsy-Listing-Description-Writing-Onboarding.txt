2. FILES & ARTWORK

A visual or other cues for the artwork itself

Sometimes reference docs for tag/material style or templates

3. FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT (REQUIRED FIELDS & ORDER)
For each artwork, output the following, in this exact order and style:

Original File Name
(original filename here, e.g. robin.5_A_serene_and_luminous_depiction_of_Waterhole_Dreaming_i_cc09e9da-b50b-418d-a2bd-ce9cb25489e7_1.jpg)

Ends with: Artwork-by-Robin-Custance-RJC-XXXX.jpg (replace XXXX with SKU or sequential number as needed)

Begins with: 2‚Äì3 words from the artwork title, hyphen-separated, relating to the subject (not copied blindly from the original file name, and never padded)

No fluff, no filler

Artwork Title:
Max 140 characters

Must include or strongly reflect:

‚ÄúHigh Resolution‚Äù

‚ÄúDigital‚Äù

‚ÄúDownload‚Äù

‚ÄúArtwork by Robin Custance‚Äù (or a direct equivalent)

Combine with clear, high-search terms a buyer would use (e.g., ‚ÄúDot Art‚Äù, ‚ÄúAboriginal Print‚Äù, ‚ÄúAustralian Wall Art‚Äù, ‚ÄúInstant Download‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrintable‚Äù etc.)

First 20 words: Strong search terms and subject clarity

NO ‚ÄúStep into,‚Äù ‚ÄúImmerse yourself,‚Äù ‚ÄúDiscover the,‚Äù etc.

Artwork Description:
400+ words, no padding

Pulitzer-quality, unique, non-formulaic, and never ‚Äúcookie-cutter‚Äù

Must be written by visually/artistic merit of the artwork (NOT the original file name unless it matches!)

Focus on: technique, visual detail, style, colour, artistic inspiration, story, cultural context (when appropriate)

High keyword density but always naturally written

Sensory, evocative, and professional, but never fluffy or generic

NO instructions, printing info, or general shop/artist bio (these are provided elsewhere)

NO leading ‚Äúdiscover/step into/immerse/experience‚Äù phrases; assume the buyer is already viewing the artwork and looking for details

Tags:
13 max

Comma separated

Highly targeted to the specific artwork (style, subject, feeling, use, context)

Rotate/search-stack: Don‚Äôt simply copy the same tags every time

Include a mix of art technique, subject, Australian/Aboriginal terms, artist branding, and digital wall art phrases

waterhole art, aboriginal dot painting, australian wall art, robin custance art, digital aboriginal print, outback home decor, sacred waterhole, high resolution art, modern dot artwork, indigenous australian art, contemporary dreamtime, native australian print, calming wall decor

Materials:
13 max

Comma separated

Up to 45 characters per entry

NO hyphens or repetition unless it‚Äôs truly accurate

Rotate and vary across listings; tailor to each artwork‚Äôs technique, style, and digital nature

Digital artwork, High resolution JPEG file, Original digital painting, Digital brushwork, Australian art file, Dot art JPEG, Downloadable image, Archival quality digital image, Contemporary art digital file, Printable wall art, Professional digital design, Layered digital composition, High clarity art download

5. NUANCES & GOLDEN RULES
Never rely on the original file name for artwork description inspiration. Only use it for SKU tracking or reference. Always base descriptions and tags on the artwork‚Äôs visual, thematic, and artistic content.

Descriptions must be unique‚Äîdo not reuse language, sentence structure, or tags across listings.

SEO filename and title must maximise search value but still sound like a human wrote them‚Äîno keyword stuffing.

Never include ‚Äúhow to print,‚Äù shop policies, or about the artist in this description section (these are added elsewhere).

No unnecessary intro sentences‚Äîevery word should serve either SEO, curation, or compelling visual/artistic analysis.

Every tag and material should be handpicked for each artwork. If two listings use the same tag/material, it‚Äôs because both genuinely fit.

Stay within all Etsy limitations:

13 tags/materials max

Tag: 20 chars max each

Materials: 45 chars max each

SEO filename: 70 chars max

Title: 140 chars max
