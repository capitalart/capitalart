    feat: Add composite preview, per-slot regeneration, approval/finalisation, and improved workflow UI
    
    - Introduced per-artwork composite preview route (/composites/<seo_folder>) showing all generated composites with category and slot info.
    - Added per-slot composite regeneration: allows selective re-generation of any mockup composite in an artwork‚Äôs set, preserving the rest.
    - Implemented composite approval/finalisation workflow:
        - Copies all approved composites, main image, and JSON to /outputs/finalised-artwork/<seo_folder>/
        - Generates zip archive for export or Sellbrite integration.
        - Marks approval in listing JSON.
    - Updated UI navigation:
        - Selector, review, and workflow pages now link directly to the latest artwork‚Äôs composite preview.
        - Users can easily preview, regenerate, and finalise composites from anywhere in the workflow.
    - Added robust logging for composite generation, regeneration, approval, and error events (logs/composites-workflow.log).
    - Improved error handling and user feedback for missing files, invalid slots, and script exceptions.
    - All actions tested: pytest -q ‚úÖ
    
    This enables a seamless, pro-grade review and approval workflow for mockup composites and sets the stage for CSV/API automation.
